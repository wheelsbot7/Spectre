  "ULTRAKILL has a fascinating narrative that not many folks even try to engage
  with. Here's why that's a shame."

Alright, brace yourselves, hot take incoming: I really like ULTRAKILL. I know,
right? Somebody had to say it. There's not much to be said on the game itself
that would justify the bandwidth it would take to deliver similarly scalding hot
takes. But dropping the sarcasm for a moment, there is one community sentient I
take issue with. Specifically the non-engagement with the less "videogame-y"
parts.

Right off the bat, ULTRAKILL does not demand the level of seriousness I am about
to give it. There are a million examples I could point to, from the sandbox
literally being gm_construct to the museum that allows you to pick up and throw
marketable plushies of everyone who worked on the game. My personal favorite has
to be `A R M B O Y ! ! !`, a secret enemy that has the audacity to be placed
next to a book. In ULTRAKILL, books are usually used to convey lore. They're
some of the only holdable objects with 0 gameplay purpose, their exclusive
function is to deliver prose. When you get close to `A R M B O Y ! ! !`, his
name appears on screen, an effect that Hakita often uses to break kayfabe. But
then there's the book.

![Armboy's book's contents, consisting of only his name. The font is so large it doesn't fit on the screen.](path)

It's a really funny game. It's self-aware, and not in a quippy "I guess this is
something I do now" kind of way where it's almost embarrassed of what it is and
trying to offset that. It knows what it is, and it's _proud_ of it. Most
importantly, it has enough confidence in itself to break character for a gag
before resuming like nothing ever happened.
