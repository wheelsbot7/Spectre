Alright, brace yourselves, hot take incoming: I really like ULTRAKILL. I know,
right? Somebody had to say it. There's not much to be said on the game itself
that would justify the bandwidth it would take to deliver similarly scalding hot
takes. But dropping the sarcasm for a moment, there is one community sentient I
take issue with. Specifically the non-engagement with the less "videogame-y"
parts.
